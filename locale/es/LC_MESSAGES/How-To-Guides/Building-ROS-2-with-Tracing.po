"Tracing instrumentation is included in the ROS 2 source code, and Linux "
"installations of ROS 2 include the LTTng tracer as a dependency. "
"Therefore, ROS 2 can be traced out-of-the-box on Linux."

"However, ROS 2 can be built from source to remove the tracepoints or "

"The ROS 2 tracing instrumentation is split into two components: function "
"instrumentation and tracepoints. First, a ROS 2 core package (e.g., "
"``rclcpp``) calls a function provided by the ``tracetools`` package. "
"Then, that function triggers a tracepoint, which records data if the "
"tracepoint is enabled at runtime."

"By default, if the tracer is not `configured to trace or if the "
"tracepoints are not enabled "
"<https://github.com/ros2/ros2_tracing#tracing>`__, they will have "
"virtually no impact on the execution. However, the tracepoints can still "
"be removed through a CMake option. Furthermore, the functions can be "
"completely removed through a CMake option, which implies that tracepoints"
" are also removed."
