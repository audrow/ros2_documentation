"Should be used for remote procedure calls that terminate quickly, e.g. "
"for querying the state of a node or doing a quick calculation such as IK."
" They should never be used for longer running processes, in particular "
"processes that might be required to preempt if exceptional situations "
"occur and they should never change or depend on state to avoid unwanted "
"side effects for other nodes."
