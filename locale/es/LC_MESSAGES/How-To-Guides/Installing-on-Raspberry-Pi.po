"ROS 2 is supported on both 32 bit (arm32) and 64 bit (arm64) ARM "
"processors. However, you can see `here "
"<https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html>`__ that arm64 receives Tier 1 "
"support, while arm32 is Tier 3. Tier 1 support means distribution "
"specific packages and binary archives are available, while Tier 3 "
"requires the user to compile ROS 2 from source."
