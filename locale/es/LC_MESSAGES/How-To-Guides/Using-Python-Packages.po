"A cautionary note, if you intended to use pre-packaged binaries (either "
"``deb`` files, or the “fat” binary distributions), the Python interpreter"
" must match what was used to build the original binaries. If you intend "
"to use something like ``virtualenv`` or ``pipenv``\\, make sure to use "
"the system interpreter. If you use something like ``conda``, it is very "
"likely that the interpreter will not match the system interpreter and "
"will be incompatible with ROS 2 binaries."
