"This guide is intended to warn users of the risks associated with the "
"Python synchronous service client ``call()`` API. It is very easy to "
"mistakenly cause deadlock when calling services synchronously, so we do "
"not recommend using ``call()``."

"As mentioned in the comments of the example above, failing to create a "

"nothing else can happen."
