"In ROS 1 you can write your code either as a `ROS node "
"<https://wiki.ros.org/Nodes>`__ or as a `ROS nodelet "
"<https://wiki.ros.org/nodelet>`__. ROS 1 nodes are compiled into "
"executables. ROS 1 nodelets on the other hand are compiled into a shared "
"library which is then loaded at runtime by a container process."

"In ROS 2 the recommended way of writing your code is similar to a nodelet"
" - we call it a ``Component``. This makes it easy to add common concepts "
"to existing code, like a `life cycle "
"<https://design.ros2.org/articles/node_lifecycle.html>`__. Having "
"different APIs, which was the biggest drawback in ROS 1, is avoided in "
"ROS 2 since both approaches use the same API."

"Since a component is only built into a shared library, it doesn't have a "
"``main`` function (see `Talker source code "
"<https://github.com/ros2/demos/blob/rolling/composition/src/talker_component.cpp>`__)."
" A component is commonly a subclass of ``rclcpp::Node``. Since it is not "
"in control of the thread, it shouldn't perform any long running or "
"blocking tasks in its constructor. Instead, it can use timers to get "
"periodic notifications. Additionally, it can create publishers, "
"subscriptions, servers, and clients."

"An important aspect of making such a class a component is that the class "
"registers itself using macros from the package ``rclcpp_components`` (see"
" the last line in the source code). This makes the component discoverable"
" when its library is being loaded into a running process - it acts as "
"kind of an entry point."
