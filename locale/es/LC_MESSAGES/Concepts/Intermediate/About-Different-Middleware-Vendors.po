"ROS 2 is built on top of DDS/RTPS as its middleware, which provides "
"discovery, serialization and transportation. `This article "
"<https://design.ros2.org/articles/ros_on_dds.html>`__ explains the "
"motivation behind using DDS implementations, and/or the RTPS wire "
"protocol of DDS, in detail. In summary, DDS is an end-to-end middleware "
"that provides features which are relevant to ROS systems, such as "
"distributed discovery (not centralized like in ROS 1) and control over "
"different \"Quality of Service\" options for the transportation."

"`DDS <https://www.omg.org/omg-dds-portal>`__ is an industry standard "

"ROS 2 supports multiple DDS/RTPS implementations because it is not "
"necessarily \"one size fits all\" when it comes to choosing a "
"vendor/implementation. There are many factors you might consider while "
"choosing a middleware implementation: logistical considerations like the "
"license, or technical considerations like platform availability, or "
"computation footprint. Vendors may provide more than one DDS or RTPS "
"implementation targeted at meeting different needs. For example, RTI has "
"a few variations of their Connext implementation that vary in purpose, "
"like one that specifically targets microcontrollers and another which "
"targets applications requiring special safety certifications (we only "
"support their standard desktop version at this time)."

"In order to use a DDS/RTPS implementation with ROS 2, a \"\\ **R**\\ OS "
"**M**\\ iddle\\ **w**\\ are interface\" (a.k.a. ``rmw`` interface or just"
" ``rmw``\\ ) package needs to be created that implements the abstract ROS"
" middleware interface using the DDS or RTPS implementation's API and "
"tools. It's a lot of work to implement and maintain RMW packages for "
"supporting DDS implementations, but supporting at least a few "
"implementations is important for ensuring that the ROS 2 codebase is not "
"tied to any one particular implementation, as users may wish to switch "
"out implementations depending on their project's needs."
