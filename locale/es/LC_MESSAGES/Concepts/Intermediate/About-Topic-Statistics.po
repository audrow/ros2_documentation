"Each statistic set is calculated in constant time and constant memory by "
"using the utilities implemented in the `libstatistics_collector "
"<https://github.com/ros-tooling/libstatistics_collector>`__ package. When"
" a new message is received by a subscription, this is a new sample for "
"calculation in the current measurement window. The average calculated is "
"simply a `moving average "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average>`__. The maximum, minimum, "
"and sample count are updated upon receipt of each new sample, whereas the"
" standard deviation is calculated using `Welford's online algorithm "
