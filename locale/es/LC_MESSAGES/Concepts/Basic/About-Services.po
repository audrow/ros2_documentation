"In ROS 2, a service refers to a remote procedure call. In other words, a "
"node can make a remote procedure call to another node which will do a "
"computation and return a result."

"In ROS 2, services are expected to return quickly, as the client is "
"generally waiting on the result. Services should never be used for longer"
" running processes, in particular processes that might need to be "
"preempted for exceptional situations. If you have a service that will be "
"doing a long-running computation, consider using an :doc:`action <About-"
"Actions>` instead."

"A service client is an entity that will request a remote service server "
"to perform a computation on its behalf. Following from the example above,"
" the service client is the entity that creates the initial message "

"the sum and return the result."
