"When a node is started, it advertises its presence to other nodes on the "
"network with the same ROS domain (set with the ROS_DOMAIN_ID environment "
"variable). Nodes respond to this advertisement with information about "
"themselves so that the appropriate connections can be made and the nodes "
"can communicate."
