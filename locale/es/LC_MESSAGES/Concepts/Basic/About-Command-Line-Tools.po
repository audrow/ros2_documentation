"ROS 2 uses a distributed discovery process for nodes to connect to each "
"other. As this process purposefully does not use a centralized discovery "
"mechanism, it can take time for ROS nodes to discover all other "
"participants in the ROS graph. Because of this, there is a long-running "
"daemon in the background that stores information about the ROS graph to "
"provide faster responses to queries, e.g. the list of node names."
