"As stated earlier, ROS 2 is a strongly-typed, anonymous publish/subscribe"
" system. Let's break down that sentence and explain it a bit more."

"A publish/subscribe system is one in which there are producers of data "
"(publishers) and consumers of data (subscribers). The publishers and "
"subscribers know how to contact each other through the concept of a "
"\"topic\", which is a common name so that the entites can find each "
"other. For instance, when you create a publisher, you must also give it a"
" string that is the name of the topic; the same goes for the subscriber. "
"Any publishers and subscribers that are on the same topic name can "
"directly communicate with each other. There may be zero or more "
"publishers and zero or more subscribers on any particular topic. When "
"data is published to the topic by any of the publishers, all subscribers "
"in the system will receive the data. This system is also known as a "
"\"bus\", since it somewhat resembles a device bus from electrical "
"engineering. This concept of a bus is part of what makes ROS 2 a powerful"
" and flexible system. Publishers and subscribers can come and go as "
"needed, meaning that debugging and introspection are natural extensions "
"to the system. For instance, if you want to record data, you can use the "
"``ros2 bag record`` command. Under the hood, ``ros2 bag record`` creates "
"a new subscriber to whatever topic you tell it, without interrupting the "
"flow of data to the other parts of the system."

"Another fact mentioned in the introduction is that ROS 2 is "
"\"anonymous\". This means that when a subscriber gets a piece of data, it"
" doesn't generally know or care which publisher originally sent it "
"(though it can find out if it wants). The benefit to this architecture is"
" that publishers and subscribers can be swapped out at will without "
"affecting the rest of the system."

"The types of each field in a ROS message are typed, and that type is "
"enforced at various levels. For instance, if the ROS message contains:"

"The semantics of each field are well-defined.  There is no automated "
"mechanism to ensure this, but all of the core ROS types have strong "
"semantics associated with them.  For instance, the IMU message contains a"
" 3-dimensional vector for the measured angular velocity, and each of the "
"dimensions is specified to be in radians/second.  Other interpretations "
"should not be placed into the message."
