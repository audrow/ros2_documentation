"Client libraries are the APIs that allow users to implement their ROS 2 "
"code. Using client libraries, users gain access to ROS 2 concepts such as"
" nodes, topics, services, etc. Client libraries come in a variety of "
"programming languages so that users may write ROS 2 code in the language "
"that is best-suited for their application. For example, you might prefer "
"to write visualization tools in Python because it makes prototyping "
"iterations faster, while for parts of your system that are concerned with"
" efficiency, the nodes might be better implemented in C++."

"Most of the functionality found in a client library is not specific to "
"the programming language of the client library. For example, the behavior"
" of parameters and the logic of namespaces should ideally be the same "
"across all programming languages. Because of this, rather than "
"implementing the common functionality from scratch, client libraries make"
" use of a common core ROS Client Library (RCL) interface that implements "
"logic and behavior of ROS concepts that is not language-specific. As a "
"result, client libraries only need to wrap the common functionality in "
"the RCL with foreign function interfaces. This keeps client libraries "
"thinner and easier to develop. For this reason the common RCL "
"functionality is exposed with C interfaces as the C language is typically"
" the easiest language for client libraries to wrap."
