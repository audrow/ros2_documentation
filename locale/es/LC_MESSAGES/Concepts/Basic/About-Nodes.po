"A node is a participant in the ROS 2 graph, which uses a :doc:`client "
"library <About-Client-Libraries>` to communicate with other nodes. Nodes "
"can communicate with other nodes within the same process, in a different "
"process, or on a different machine. Nodes are typically the unit of "
"computation in a ROS graph; each node should do one logical thing."

"Nodes can :doc:`publish <About-Topics>` to named topics to deliver data "
"to other nodes, or :doc:`subscribe <About-Topics>` to named topics to get"
" data from other nodes. They can also act as a :doc:`service client "
"<About-Services>` to have another node perform a computation on their "
"behalf, or as a :doc:`service server <About-Services>` to provide "
"functionality to other nodes. For long-running computations, a node can "
"act as an :doc:`action client <About-Actions>` to perform it, or as an "
":doc:`action server <About-Actions>` to have another node perform it. "
"Nodes can provide configurable :doc:`parameters <About-Parameters>` to "
"change behavior during run-time."
