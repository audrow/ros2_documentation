"A ROS 2 system typically consists of many nodes running across many "
"different processes (and even different machines). While it is possible "
"to run each of these nodes separately, it gets cumbersome quite quickly."

"The launch system in ROS 2 is meant to automate the running of many nodes"
" with a single command. It helps the user describe the configuration of "
"their system and then executes it as described. The configuration of the "
"system includes what programs to run, where to run them, what arguments "
"to pass them, and ROS-specific conventions which make it easy to reuse "
"components throughout the system by giving them each a different "
"configuration. It is also responsible for monitoring the state of the "
"processes launched, and reporting and/or reacting to changes in the state"
" of those processes."

"All of the above is specified in a launch file, which can be written in "
"Python, XML, or YAML. This launch file can then be run using the ``ros2 "
"launch`` command, and all of the nodes specified will be run."
