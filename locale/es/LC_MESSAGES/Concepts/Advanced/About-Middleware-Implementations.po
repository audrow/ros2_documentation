"All of the current ROS middleware implementations are based on full or "
"partial DDS implementations. For example, there is a middleware "
"implementation that uses RTI's Connext DDS and an implementation which "
"uses eProsima's Fast DDS. Because of this, there are some shared "
"|packages| amongst most DDS based middleware implementations."

"The ``<implementation_name>_cmake_module`` |package| contains any CMake "
"Modules and functions needed to find the supporting dependencies for the "

"provides wrapper logic around the CMake Module shipped with RTI Connext "
"DDS to make sure that all packages that depend on it will select the same"
" installation of RTI Connext DDS. Similarly, ``fastrtps_cmake_module`` "
"includes a CMake Module to find eProsima's Fast DDS and "
"``gurumdds_cmake_module`` includes a CMake Module to find GurumNetworks "
"GurumDDS. Not all implementations will have a package like this: for "
"example, Eclipe's Cyclone DDS already provides a CMake Module which is "
"used directly by its RMW implementation without the need of additional "

"standard <http://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-XTypes>`_. As such, rmw "
