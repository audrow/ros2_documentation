"As the diagram shows, these |APIs| are stacked such that the typical ROS "
"user will use the |client library| |API|, e.g. ``rclcpp``, to implement "
"their code (executable or library). The implementation of the |client "
"libraries|, e.g. ``rclcpp``, use the ``rcl`` interface which provides "
"access to the ROS graph and graph events. The ``rcl`` implementation in "
"turn uses the ``rmw`` |API| to access the ROS graph. The purpose of the "
"``rcl`` implementation is to provide a common implementation for more "
"complex ROS concepts and utilities that may be used by various |client "
"libraries|, while remaining agnostic to the underlying middleware being "
"used. The purpose of the ``rmw`` interface is to capture the absolute "
"minimum middleware functionality needed to support ROS's client "
"libraries. Finally, the implementation of the ``rmw`` |API| is provided "
"by a middleware implementation specific |package|, e.g. "
"``rmw_fastrtps_cpp``, the library of which is compiled against vendor "
"specific DDS interfaces and types."

"In the diagram above there is also a box labeled ``ros_to_dds``, and the "
"purpose of this box is to represent a category of possible packages which"
" allow the user to access DDS vendor specific objects and settings using "
"the ROS equivalents. One of the goals of this abstraction interface is to"
" completely insulate the ROS user space code from the middleware being "
"used, so that changing DDS vendors or even middleware technology has a "
"minimal impact on the users code. However, we recognize that on occasion "
"it is useful to reach into the implementation and manually adjust "
"settings despite the consequences that might have. By requiring the use "
"of one of these packages in order to access the underlying DDS vendor's "
"objects, we can avoid exposing vendor specific symbols and headers in the"
" normal interface. It also makes it easy to see what code is potentially "
"violating the vendor portability by inspecting the package's dependencies"
" to see if one of these ``ros_to_dds`` packages are being used."

"\"static\" type support which requires generated versions of a function "

"However, dynamic type support requires that the underlying middleware "

"DDS-XTypes standard allows for publishing of messages using meta "

" is required in the underlying middleware in order to support dynamic "
