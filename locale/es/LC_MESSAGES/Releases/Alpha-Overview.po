"On November 3, 2015, we are releasing ROS 2 alpha2, code-named **Baling "
"wire**. Our primary goal with this release is to add more features, while"
" also addressing the feedback we received for the previous alpha 1 "
"release. To that end, we built a set of `demos <../../Tutorials>` that "
"show some of the key features of ROS 2. We encourage you to try out those"
" demos, look at the code that implements them, and `provide feedback "
"<../../Contact>`. We're especially interested to know how well (or "
"poorly) we're addressing use cases that are important to you."
