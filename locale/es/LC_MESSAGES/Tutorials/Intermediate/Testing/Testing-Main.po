"You can make incremental updates to your code more quickly. ROS has "
"hundreds of packages with many interdependencies, so it can be hard to "
"anticipate the problems a small change might cause. If your change passes"
" the unit tests, you can be more confident that you haven't introduced "
"problems — or at least the problems aren't your fault."

"You can refactor your code with greater confidence. Passing the unit "

"It leads to better designed code. Unit tests force you to write your code"
" so that it can be more easily tested. This often means keeping your "
"underlying functions and framework separate, which is one of our design "
"goals with ROS code."

"They prevent recurring bugs (bug regressions). It's a good practice to "
"write a unit test for every bug you fix. In fact, write the unit test "
"before you fix the bug. This will help you to precisely, or even "
"deterministically, reproduce the bug, and much more precisely understand "
"what the problem is. As a result, you will also create a better patch, "
"which you can then test with your regression test to verify that the bug "
"is fixed. That way the bug won't accidentally get reintroduced if the "
"code gets modified later on. It also means that it will be easier to "
"convince the reviewer of the patch that the problem is solved, and the "
"contribution is of high quality."

"Other people can work on your code more easily (an automatic form of "
"documentation). It can be hard to figure out whether or not you've broken"
" someone else's code when you make a change. The unit tests are a tool "
"for other developers to validate their changes. Automatic tests document "
"your coding decisions, and communicate to other developers automatically "
"about their violation. Thus tests become documentation for your code — a "
"documentation that does not need to be read for the most time, and when "
"it does need to be inspected the test system will precisely indicate what"
" to read (which tests fail). By writing automatic tests you make other "
"contributors faster. This improves the entire ROS project."

"It is much easier to become a contributor to ROS if we have automated "
"unit tests. It is very difficult for new external developers to "
"contribute to your components. When they make changes to code, they are "
"often doing it in the blind, driven by a lot of guesswork. By providing a"
" harness of automated tests, you help them in the task. They get "
"immediate feedback for their changes. It becomes easier to contribute to "
"a project, and new contributors to join more easily. Also their first "
"contributions are of higher quality, which decreases the workload on "
"maintainers. A win-win!"

"Automatic tests simplify maintainership. Especially for mature packages, "
"which change more slowly, and mostly need to be updated to new "
"dependencies, an automatic test suite helps to very quickly establish "
"whether the package still works. This makes it much easier to decide "
"whether the package is still supported or not."

"Automatic tests amplify the value of Continuous Integration. Regression "
"tests, along with normal scenario-based requirements tests, contribute to"
" overall body of automated tests for your component. Your component is "
"better tested against evolution of other APIs that it depends on (CI "
"servers will tell you better and more precisely what problems develop in "
"your code)."

"Perhaps the most important benefit of writing tests is that tests make "
"you a good citizen. Tests influence quality in the long term. It is a "
"well accepted practice in many open-source projects. By writing "

"ecosystem."

"You need to develop a test, which sometimes may be difficult or costly. "
"Sometimes it might also be nontrivial, as the test should be automatic. "
"Things get particularly hairy if your tests should involve special "
"hardware (they should not: try to use simulation, mock the hardware, or "
"narrow down the test to a smaller software problem) or require external "
"environment, for instance human operators."

"Regression tests and other automatic tests need to be maintained. When "
"the design of the component changes, a lot of tests become invalidated "
"(for instance they no longer compile, or throw runtime exceptions related"
" to the API design). These tests fail not only because the redesign re-"
"introduced bugs but also because they need to be updated to the new "
"design. Occasionally, with bigger redesigns, old regression tests should "
"be dropped."
