"In previous tutorials, we recreated the turtle demo by writing a "
":doc:`tf2 broadcaster <./Writing-A-Tf2-Broadcaster-Py>` and a :doc:`tf2 "
"listener <./Writing-A-Tf2-Listener-Py>`. We also learned how to :doc:`add"
" a new frame to the transformation tree <./Adding-A-Frame-Py>`. Now we "
"will learn more about the ``timeout`` argument which makes the "
"``lookup_transform`` wait for the specified transform for up to the "
"specified duration before throwing an exception. This tool can be useful "
"to listen for transforms that are published at varying rates or those "
"incoming source with unreliable networking and non negligible latency. "
"This tutorial will teach you how use the timeout in ``lookup_transform`` "
"function to wait for a transform to be available on the tf2 tree."
