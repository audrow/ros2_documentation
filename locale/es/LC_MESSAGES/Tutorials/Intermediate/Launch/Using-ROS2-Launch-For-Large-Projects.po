"Large applications on a robot typically involve several interconnected "
"nodes, each of which can have many parameters. Simulation of multiple "
"turtles in the turtle simulator can serve as a good example. The turtle "
"simulation consists of multiple turtle nodes, the world configuration, "
"and the TF broadcaster and listener nodes. Between all of the nodes, "
"there are a large number of ROS parameters that affect the behavior and "
"appearance of these nodes. ROS 2 launch files allow us to start all nodes"
" and set corresponding parameters in one place. By the end of a tutorial,"
" you will build the ``launch_turtlesim_launch.py`` launch file in the "
"``launch_tutorial`` package. This launch file will bring up different "
"nodes responsible for the simulation of two turtlesim simulations, "
"starting TF broadcasters and listener, loading parameters, and launching "
"an RViz configuration. In this tutorial, we'll go over this launch file "
"and all related features used."
