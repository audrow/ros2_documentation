"In this tutorial, we’re going to revise the R2D2 model we made in the "
":doc:`previous tutorial <./Building-a-Visual-Robot-Model-with-URDF-from-"
"Scratch>` so that it has movable joints. In the previous model, all of "
"the joints were fixed. Now we’ll explore three other important types of "
"joints: continuous, revolute and prismatic."
