"Several advanced robot simulators can be used with ROS 2, such as Gazebo,"
" Webots, etc. Unlike turtlesim, they provide fairly realistic results "
"relying on physics-based models for robots, sensors, actuators and "
"objects. Hence, what you observe in simulation is very close to what you "
"will get when transferring your ROS 2 controllers to a real robot."
