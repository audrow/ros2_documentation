"The ``webots_ros2`` package provides an interface between ROS 2 and "
"Webots. It includes several sub-packages, including "
"``webots_ros2_driver``, which allows ROS nodes to communicate with "
"Webots. Other sub-packages are mainly examples that show multiple "
"possible implementations using the interface. In this tutorial, you are "
"going to install the package and learn how to run one of these examples."
