"The ``webots_ros2`` package provides an interface between ROS 2 and "
"Webots. It includes several sub-packages, including "
"``webots_ros2_driver``, which allows you to start Webots and communicate "

"possible implementations using the interface. In this tutorial, you are "
"going to install the package and learn how to run one of these examples."

"On macOS, a solution based on UTM virtual machines provides an improved "
"user experience with ROS 2 compared to native macOS installation, as it "
"runs ROS in a Linux environment. However, Webots should be installed "
"natively on macOS and it will be able to communicate with the ROS nodes "
"running in the Virtual Machine (VM). This solution allows for native 3D "
"hardware acceleration for Webots. The VM runs all the ROS part (including"
" RViz) and connects to the host machine through TCP to start Webots. A "
"shared folder allows the script to transfer the world and other resource "
"files from the VM to macOS where Webots is running."
