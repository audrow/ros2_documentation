"In this tutorial, you will learn how to implement a reset handler in a "
"robot simulation using Webots. The Webots reset button reverts the world "
"to the initial state and restarts controllers. It is convenient as it "
"quickly resets the simulation, but in the context of ROS 2, robot "
"controllers are not started again making the simulation stop. The reset "
"handler allows you to restart specific nodes or perform additional "
"actions when the reset button in Webots is pressed. This can be useful "
"for scenarios where you need to reset the state of your simulation or "
"restart specific components without completely restarting the complete "
"ROS system."

"It is not possible to use the ``respawn`` property on the "
"``ros2_control`` node, as the spawner exits during launch time and not "
"when the simulation is reset. Instead we should declare a list of nodes "
"in a function (e.g. ``get_ros2_control_spawners``). The nodes of this "
"list are started along other nodes when executing the launch file. With "
"the ``reset_handler``, the function is also declared as action to start "
"when the ``robot_driver`` node exits, which corresponds to the moment "
"when the simulation is reset in the Webots interface. The "
"``robot_driver`` node still has the ``respawn`` property set to ``True``,"
" so that it gets restarted along with ``ros2_control`` nodes."

"With the current ROS 2 launch API, there is no way to make the reset work"
